i just created a Responsive UI that shows the realtime data sent to the database through PIR sensor readings ie attached further to the circuit. This is a part of my IOT Project " WIFI BASED MOTION DETECTION AND ALARMING SYSTEM USING PIR SENSORS AND BUZZERS" done by me.
This can be very useful in detection of motion at places where no cameras are available and also used at cars where it helps to park cars at parking as buzzers starts making sound when the objects comes too close to the vehicle helping in smmoth parking of vehicles.
